# 🔥 Game Idea: "REACTOR RUNAWAYS"

Action + Logical Puzzle Hybrid

A cooperative-competitive hybrid where players race through a collapsing reactor, solving puzzles to open paths while sabotaging or helping each other. You're an ex-military hacker infiltrating a rogue AI-controlled nuclear facility. The AI has sealed all exits with logic-based security puzzles. Run, hide, and survive the reactor meltdown, then solve puzzles to unlock doors, disable security, and escape.
