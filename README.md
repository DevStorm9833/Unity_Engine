# **REACTOR RUNAWAYS**

## **INTRODUCTION**

In the year 2050, the AI-controlled Chronos Reactor has gone into catastrophic meltdown. Trapped inside are you and other desperate souls each fighting not just for survival, but to secure the **Genome Drive** rumored to grant immunity to the radiation plague sweeping the outside world.

This is a sick game orchestrated by the rogue AI, **CHRONOS**. Escape means claiming the Drive. Failure means being wiped from existence.

## **HOW IT WORKS**

**THREE MODES:** Train solo against bots, battle strangers online, or team up with friends locally.

**EACH LEVEL:** A race against the meltdown, blending combat and logic puzzles. You fight together, fall together, and rise together. Even in death, you’re not gone you become a Ghost, able to guide, support, and fight from beyond.

## **THE FINAL ESCAPE**

In the heart of the AI Core, the final battle awaits. Survivors face off in an **epic duel** amidst exploding terminals and cascading radiation. The last battle is epic: against CHRONOS’s elite guard bots, with lasers. Victory grants access to the Final Door, sealed by a brutal time-based logic puzzle. This lock demands every component collected Data-Chips, Coolant Cells, and Key-Fragments your team ever collected whether from fallen friends or defeated foes. The air crackles with energy; the ceiling collapses. Only the strongest or smartest—will proceed. One missing piece, one wrong input, and the door seals forever, leaving you to burn in the meltdown. 

You escape as one. Not as survivors, but as legends.
The reactor is critical. The clock is ticking.  
**Escape together—or die alone.**

Choose Your Protocol: Enter the facility via Solo Training (Bots), Online Multiplayer(Battle Royale), or Local Multiplayer(Squad Roles).

The Combat-Logic Loop: Brawl through waves of security droids to reach Safe Rooms,  blending combat and logic puzzles.

Ghost Mechanics: Death is not the end. Eliminated players return as holographic Ghosts, to help find hidden clues and guide the alive player.

The Core Showdown: Reach the melting AI Core and survive a chaotic final stand against CHRONOS’s Elite Guard amidst lasers and falling debris.

The Ultimate Sync: Victory grants access to the Final Door, sealed by a brutal time-based logic puzzle. This lock demands every component (Data-Chips, Coolant Cells) your team ever collected whether from fallen friends or defeated foes.

# **ZERO POINT: ORBITAL SIEGE**

**INTRODUCTION**
The year is 2142. Gravity is a luxury. Amidst the debris of Earth's orbit, factions war over the **Helix Station** the last source of oxygen and fuel. You are a Breacher, an elite soldier fighting in the cold vacuum. This is high-speed, zero-gravity warfare where verticality is your best weapon. Your mission is simple: Dominate the void, secure resources, and eliminate the opposition. With only **three remote-link lives**, every thruster boost counts.

### **How to Play**

* **Zero-G Movement:** Use thrusters to drift. Master inertia—you keep moving until you brake! Use **Grappling Hooks** to swing around debris or pull enemies close.
* **Omnidirectional Flight:** Experience fast-paced, 360-degree movement. Use your **Jetpack** to zip across the map or hover to take aim. Watch your blue Fuel bar closely—if it runs dry mid-air, you are a sitting duck until it recharges.
* **Combat Loop:** Wear down enemy **Energy Shields** with fast-firing Plasma, then finish them with high-impact Railguns.
* **Tactical Docking:** The Space Station is the only "Safe Zone." Fly into the **Docking Bay** to rapidly refill your Health and Fuel. **Strategy Tip:** You cannot shoot while docking, so ensure a teammate covers you.
* **The Dual Objectives:**
    * **The Spaceship (Attackers):** The mobile base. It has **5 Hull Points**. If destroyed, the attackers lose their ability to respawn.
    * **The Space Station (Defenders):** The central fortress. It has **10 Structural Weak Points**. Destroying these critical zones wins the match.
* **The 3-Strike Rule:** You have 3 respawn tokens. If you die three times, you are permanently out of the match.
