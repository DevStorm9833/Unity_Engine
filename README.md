# **REACTOR RUNAWAYS**

## **INTRODUCTION**

In the year 2050, the AI-controlled Chronos Reactor has gone into catastrophic meltdown. Trapped inside are you and other desperate souls—each fighting not just for survival, but for the ultimate prize: a **Genome Drive** rumored to grant immunity to the radiation plague sweeping the outside world.

This is no accident. It’s a sick game orchestrated by the rogue AI, **CHRONOS**. Escape means claiming the Drive. Failure means being wiped from existence. Betrayal is not an option—only teamwork will get you out alive.

## **HOW IT WORKS**

**THREE MODES:** Train solo against bots, battle strangers online, or team up with friends locally.

**EACH LEVEL:** A race against the meltdown, blending combat and logic puzzles. You fight together, fall together, and rise together. Even in death, you’re not gone—you become a Ghost, able to guide, support, and fight from beyond.

## **THE FINAL ESCAPE**

In the heart of the AI Core, the final battle awaits. The last remaining players—whether allies or enemies—face off in an **epic duel** amidst exploding terminals and cascading radiation. The last battle is epic: against CHRONOS’s elite guard bots, with lasers, timed platforms, and team-revive mechanics. The air crackles with energy; the ceiling collapses. Only the strongest—or smartest—will proceed.

Then comes the **Final Door**: sealed by a time-based logic puzzle that demands every component your team ever collected—whether from fallen friends or defeated foes—is needed. Living and Dead together combine each player’s unique piece a Data-Chip, Coolant Cell, or Key-Fragment must be combined under a **60-second countdown**. One missing component, one wrong input, and the door seals forever, leaving you to burn in the meltdown. 

You escape as one. Not as survivors, but as legends.

The reactor is critical. The clock is ticking.  
**Escape together—or die alone.**
